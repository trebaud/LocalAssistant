## 👀 What's This?

```
YOU: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
AI: *actually checks real weather data* "It's 22°C and sunny in Tokyo right now."
```

No cap. Your AI assistant can now interact with real tools and APIs without hallucinating responses.

## 🚀 Why It Slaps

- 💯 **Zero hallucinations** - Gets real data from real sources
- 🔥 **Plug & play tools** - Weather, location, search, whatever you need
- 🤯 **100% locally powered** - Runs on Ollama with zero cloud dependencies
- 🔒 **Privacy first** - No data ever leaves your machine
- 🔌 **Extensible** - Build and add your own tools

## 🏃‍♂️ Get Started in 30 Seconds

```bash
git clone git@github.com:trebaud/LocalAssistant.git

bun install

bun start "What's the weather in Montreal?"
```

## 🧩 Make It Your Own

Want to add your own tools? It's stupid simple:

1. Define what your tool does
2. Implement the logic
3. Watch your AI assistant gain new superpowers

## 🤝 Vibe Check

This project is for builders who:
- Want AI that actually *does things* instead of just talking
- Are tired of rate limits and API costs from the big players
- Believe in privacy-first technology with local models
- Love the power of Ollama but want to extend it with real tools
- Want to experiment without a massive learning curve

Built with ❤️, Ollama, and coffee.
